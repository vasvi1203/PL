    <p><strong>Learn about ATP. A brief introduction:</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Just as living things must continually consume food to replenish their energy supplies, cells must continually produce more energy to replenish that used by the many energy-requiring chemical reactions that constantly take place. Together, all of the chemical reactions that take place inside cells, including those that consume or generate energy, are referred to as the cell’s metabolism. A living cell cannot store significant amounts of free energy. Free energy is energy that is not stored in molecules. Excess free energy would result in an increase of heat in the cell, which would denature enzymes and other proteins, and destroy the cell. Instead, a cell must be able to store energy safely and release it for use only as needed. Living cells accomplish this using ATP, which can be used to fill any energy need of the cell. How? It functions like a rechargeable battery. When ATP is broken down, energy is released. This energy is used by the cell to do work. For example, in the mechanical work of muscle contraction, ATP supplies energy to move the contractile muscle proteins.</strong></p>
